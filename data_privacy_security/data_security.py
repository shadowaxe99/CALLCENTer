# data_privacy_security/data_security.py

```python
class DataSecurity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_privacy = DataPrivacy()

    def ensure_compliance(self):
        self.data_privacy.protect_callers_personal_information()

class DataPrivacy:
    def protect_callers_personal_information(self):
        # Implement secure data storage and transmission protocols
        pass
```

This code defines the `DataSecurity` class and the `DataPrivacy` class. The `DataSecurity` class has a dependency on the `DataPrivacy` class. The `DataSecurity` class ensures compliance with data privacy regulations by calling the `protect_callers_personal_information` method of the `DataPrivacy` class, which is responsible for implementing secure data storage and transmission protocols.
