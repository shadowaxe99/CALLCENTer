```python
class SpeechToText:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def convert_speech_to_text(self, audio):
        # Implement speech-to-text conversion logic here
        text = ""

        # Return the converted text
        return text


class TextToSpeech:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def convert_text_to_speech(self, text):
        # Implement text-to-speech conversion logic here
        audio = ""

        # Return the converted audio
        return audio
```

In the `speech_to_text/text_to_speech.py` file, we have defined two classes: `SpeechToText` and `TextToSpeech`. 

The `SpeechToText` class has a method `convert_speech_to_text` that takes an audio input and converts it into text using the speech-to-text conversion logic. You can implement the specific speech-to-text conversion logic within the method.

The `TextToSpeech` class has a method `convert_text_to_speech` that takes a text input and converts it into audio using the text-to-speech conversion logic. Again, you can implement the specific text-to-speech conversion logic within the method.

Please note that the implementation of the conversion logic is not provided in the generated code. You will need to add the actual implementation based on the speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies or APIs you choose to use in your call center application.
