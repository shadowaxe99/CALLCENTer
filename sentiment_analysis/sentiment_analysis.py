```python
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    # Implement sentiment analysis logic here
    # Return the sentiment score or label
    pass

def adjust_response(sentiment, response):
    # Adjust the AI agent response based on the sentiment
    # Return the adjusted response
    pass
```

In the `sentiment_analysis.py` file, you can implement the sentiment analysis functionality for the AI call center. The `analyze_sentiment` function takes in a text input and performs sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment score or label. You can use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or library to perform this analysis.

The `adjust_response` function can be used to adjust the AI agent's response based on the sentiment of the caller. For example, if the sentiment is negative, the AI agent can provide a more empathetic or supportive response. You can define the logic for adjusting the response based on the sentiment.

Remember to implement the actual sentiment analysis logic and adjust the response accordingly in the provided functions.
