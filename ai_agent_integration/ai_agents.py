This code defines the `AIAgents` class, which represents the AI agents in the call center. It also defines the `NLPDialogueManagement` class, which handles the extraction of intents using NLU technology. The `NLUTechnology` class is a placeholder for the actual NLU model.

The `AIAgents` class has a `handle_query` method that takes a query as input, extracts the intent using the `NLPDialogueManagement` instance, and generates a response based on the intent. The `generate_response` method contains logic to generate different responses based on different intents.

The code also creates instances of the required classes and demonstrates an example usage by handling a query and printing the response.
