In the `analytics.py` file, we define two classes: `MonitoringTools` and `Analytics`.

The `MonitoringTools` class is responsible for tracking and storing performance metrics related to AI agents, call success rates, and user satisfaction. It has three dictionaries to store the data: `ai_agent_performance`, `call_success_rates`, and `user_satisfaction`. The `track_ai_agent_performance`, `track_call_success_rate`, and `track_user_satisfaction` methods are used to update the respective dictionaries with new data.

The `Analytics` class takes an instance of `MonitoringTools` as a parameter in its constructor. It provides methods to analyze the performance of AI agents, call success rates, and user satisfaction. Currently, the analysis methods are empty, but you can implement the logic to analyze the data stored in the `MonitoringTools` instance.

Remember to import the necessary dependencies and ensure that the shared dependencies are consistent with the other files.
