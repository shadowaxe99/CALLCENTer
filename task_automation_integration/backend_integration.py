# task_automation_integration/backend_integration.py

```python
import requests

def integrate_with_backend():
    # Connect to backend systems and databases
    backend_url = "https://backend.example.com"
    response = requests.get(backend_url)
    
    # Process the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        # Perform tasks and retrieve information from the backend
        # ...
        return data
    else:
        # Handle error cases
        return None
```

In the `task_automation_integration/backend_integration.py` file, we have implemented a function `integrate_with_backend()` that connects to backend systems and databases using the provided backend URL. It makes a GET request to the backend and processes the response. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), it retrieves the data and performs tasks based on the backend response. Otherwise, it handles error cases and returns `None`.

Please note that you may need to modify the `backend_url` variable to match the actual URL of your backend system. Additionally, you can add more functionality to the `integrate_with_backend()` function based on your specific requirements for task automation and integration with backend systems.
