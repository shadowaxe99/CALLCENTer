```python
import requests

def connect_to_api(api_url):
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

def process_api_data(api_data):
    # Process the API data and perform necessary operations
    pass

def integrate_with_api(api_url):
    api_data = connect_to_api(api_url)
    if api_data:
        processed_data = process_api_data(api_data)
        # Perform further operations with the processed data
        pass
    else:
        # Handle API connection error
        pass
```

In the `api_integration.py` file, we have defined three functions:

1. `connect_to_api(api_url)`: This function sends a GET request to the specified API URL and returns the JSON response if the request is successful (status code 200). Otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. `process_api_data(api_data)`: This function is responsible for processing the API data received from the `connect_to_api` function. You can implement the necessary logic to extract and manipulate the relevant information from the API response.

3. `integrate_with_api(api_url)`: This function serves as the entry point for integrating with the API. It calls the `connect_to_api` function to retrieve the API data and then passes the data to the `process_api_data` function for further processing. You can add additional operations or logic as needed.

Please note that the code provided is a basic template, and you will need to customize it according to your specific API integration requirements.
