```python
class NaturalLanguageInteraction:
    def __init__(self, nlu_technology):
        self.nlu_technology = nlu_technology

    def comprehend_intent(self, speech):
        intent = self.nlu_technology.comprehend_intent(speech)
        return intent

    def extract_information(self, speech):
        information = self.nlu_technology.extract_information(speech)
        return information

    def interact(self, speech):
        intent = self.comprehend_intent(speech)
        information = self.extract_information(speech)
        response = self.generate_response(intent, information)
        return response

    def generate_response(self, intent, information):
        # Logic to generate response based on intent and information
        response = "Thank you for your query. We will get back to you shortly."
        return response
```

In the code above, we have defined a class `NaturalLanguageInteraction` that handles the natural language interaction in the automated AI call center. It takes an instance of the `nlu_technology` class as a dependency.

The `comprehend_intent` method uses the `nlu_technology` to comprehend the caller's intent based on their speech input.

The `extract_information` method uses the `nlu_technology` to extract relevant information from the caller's speech input.

The `interact` method combines the `comprehend_intent` and `extract_information` methods to comprehensively interact with the caller's speech input.

The `generate_response` method generates a response based on the caller's intent and extracted information.

This code provides a basic structure for handling natural language interaction in the automated AI call center. You can further enhance the logic in the `generate_response` method to provide more personalized and accurate responses based on the caller's intent and information.
