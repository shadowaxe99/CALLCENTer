```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None

    def load_model(self, model_path):
        # Load the NLU model from the specified path
        self.model = load_model(model_path)

    def process_speech(self, speech_text):
        # Process the speech text using the NLU model
        processed_text = self.model.process(speech_text)
        return processed_text

    def extract_intent(self, processed_text):
        # Extract the intent from the processed text
        intent = self.model.extract_intent(processed_text)
        return intent

    def extract_entities(self, processed_text):
        # Extract the entities from the processed text
        entities = self.model.extract_entities(processed_text)
        return entities
```

This code represents the `NLUTechnology` class that can be used for natural language understanding in an automated AI call center. The class has methods to load the NLU model, process speech text, extract intent, and extract entities from the processed text. You can further customize and implement the specific NLU model and methods based on your requirements and the NLU technology you choose to use.
