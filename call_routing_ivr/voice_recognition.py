# call_routing_ivr/voice_recognition.py

```python
class VoiceRecognition:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def recognize_voice(self, audio):
        # Implement voice recognition logic here
        pass

    def route_call(self, recognized_text):
        # Implement call routing logic based on recognized text here
        pass
```

This code represents the `VoiceRecognition` class in the `call_routing_ivr/voice_recognition.py` file. It provides a basic structure for voice recognition and call routing functionality. You can implement the actual logic for voice recognition and call routing within the respective methods (`recognize_voice` and `route_call`).
