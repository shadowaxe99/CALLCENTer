This code defines a `KnowledgeBase` class that represents a collection of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers. The class provides methods to add new FAQs, retrieve answers for specific questions, remove FAQs, and clear the entire FAQ collection.

To use this class, you can create an instance of `KnowledgeBase` and then use the provided methods to interact with the FAQ data. For example:

```python
# Create a new knowledge base
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Add FAQs
kb.add_faq("What is your return policy?", "Our return policy allows customers to return items within 30 days of purchase.")

# Get answer for a question
answer = kb.get_answer("What is your return policy?")
print(answer)  # Output: "Our return policy allows customers to return items within 30 days of purchase."

# Remove a FAQ
kb.remove_faq("What is your return policy?")

# Clear all FAQs
kb.clear_faq()
```

You can customize the `KnowledgeBase` class and its methods according to your specific requirements for managing FAQs in your automated AI call center.
