In the `continuous_learning_improvements/ai_agent_updates.py` file, we define a function `update_ai_agents` that takes in `knowledge` and `feedback` as arguments. This function is responsible for updating the AI agents with new knowledge and feedback from caller interactions.

The `knowledge` parameter is a dictionary containing new knowledge that needs to be incorporated into the AI agents. The `feedback` parameter is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents feedback from a caller interaction. Each feedback item contains the `conversation_id`, `rating`, and `comments`.

Within the function, we iterate over each AI agent and call the `update_knowledge` method to incorporate the new knowledge into the AI agents.

Next, we iterate over each feedback item and extract the `conversation_id`, `rating`, and `comments`. We then update the AI models using the `update_model` method of the `ai_models` object, passing in the `conversation_id` and `rating`.

Finally, we incorporate the feedback comments into the training data using the `add_feedback` method of the `training_data` object.

This function allows for continuous learning and improvement of the AI agents by updating their knowledge and incorporating feedback from caller interactions.
